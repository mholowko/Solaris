abstract = {New synthetic biology capabilities hold the promise of dramatically improving our ability to engineer biological systems. However, a fundamental hurdle in realizing this potential is our inability to accurately predict biological behavior after modifying the corresponding genotype. Kinetic models have traditionally been used to predict pathway dynamics in bioengineered systems, but they take significant time to develop, and rely heavily on domain expertise. Here, we show that the combination of machine learning and abundant multiomics data (proteomics and metabolomics) can be used to effectively predict pathway dynamics in an automated fashion. The new method outperforms a classical kinetic model, and produces qualitative and quantitative predictions that can be used to productively guide bioengineering efforts. This method systematically leverages arbitrary amounts of new data to improve predictions, and does not assume any particular interactions, but rather implicitly chooses the most predictive ones.},

@article{Nielsen2016,
abstract = {As synthetic biology techniques become more powerful, researchers are anticipating a future in which the design of biological circuits will be similar to the design of integrated circuits in electronics. Nielsen et al. describe what is essentially a programming language to design computational circuits in living cells. The circuits generated on plasmids expressed in Escherichia coli required careful insulation from their genetic context, but primarily functioned as specified. The circuits could, for example, regulate cellular functions in response to multiple environmental signals. Such a strategy can facilitate the development of more complex circuits by genetic engineering.Science, this issue p. 10.1126/science.aac7341INTRODUCTIONCells respond to their environment, make decisions, build structures, and coordinate tasks. Underlying these processes are computational operations performed by networks of regulatory proteins that integrate signals and control the timing of gene expression. Harnessing this capability is critical for biotechnology projects that require decision-making, control, sensing, or spatial organization. It has been shown that cells can be programmed using synthetic genetic circuits composed of regulators organized to generate a desired operation. However, the construction of even simple circuits is time-intensive and unreliable.RATIONALEElectronic design automation (EDA) was developed to aid engineers in the design of semiconductor-based electronics. In an effort to accelerate genetic circuit design, we applied principles from EDA to enable increased circuit complexity and to simplify the incorporation of synthetic gene regulation into genetic engineering projects. We used the hardware description language Verilog to enable a user to describe a circuit function. The user also specifies the sensors, actuators, and “user constraints file” (UCF), which defines the organism, gate technology, and valid operating conditions. Cello (www.cellocad.org) uses this information to automatically design a DNA sequence encoding the desired circuit. This is done via a set of algorithms that parse the Verilog text, create the circuit diagram, assign gates, balance constraints to build the DNA, and simulate performance.RESULTSCello designs circuits by drawing upon a library of Boolean logic gates. Here, the gate technology consists of NOT/NOR logic based on repressors. Gate connection is simplified by defining the input and output signals as RNA polymerase (RNAP) fluxes. We found that the gates need to be insulated from their genetic context to function reliably in the context of different circuits. Each gate is isolated using strong terminators to block RNAP leakage, and input interchangeability is improved using ribozymes and promoter spacers. These parts are varied for each gate to avoid breakage due to recombination. Measuring the load of each gate and incorporating this into the optimization algorithms further reduces evolutionary pressure.Cello was applied to the design of 60 circuits for Escherichia coli, where the circuit function was specified using Verilog code and transformed to a DNA sequence. The DNA sequences were built as specified with no additional tuning, requiring 880,000 base pairs of DNA assembly. Of these, 45 circuits performed correctly in every output state (up to 10 regulators and 55 parts). Across all circuits, 92{\%} of the 412 output states functioned as predicted.CONCLUSIONOur work constitutes a hardware description language for programming living cells. This required the co-development of design algorithms with gates that are sufficiently simple and robust to be connected by automated algorithms. We demonstrate that engineering principles can be applied to identify and suppress errors that complicate the compositions of larger systems. This approach leads to highly repetitive and modular genetics, in stark contrast to the encoding of natural regulatory networks. The use of a hardware-independent language and the creation of additional UCFs will allow a single design to be transformed into DNA for different organisms, genetic endpoints, operating conditions, and gate technologies.Genetic programming using Cello.A user specifies the desired circuit function in Verilog code, and this is transformed into a DNA sequence. An example circuit is shown (0xF6); red and blue curves are predicted output states for populations of cells, and solid black distributions are experimental flow cytometry data. The outputs are shown for all combinations of sensor states; plus and minus signs indicate the presence or absence of input signal. RBS, ribosome binding site; RPU, relative promoter unit; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein.Computation can be performed in living cells by DNA-encoded circuits that process sensory information and control biological functions. Their construction is time-intensive, requiring manual part assembly and balancing of regulator expression. We describe a design environment, Cello, in which a user writes Verilog code that is automatically transformed into a DNA sequence. Algorithms build a circuit diagram, assign and connect gates, and simulate performance. Reliable circuit design requires the insulation of gates from genetic context, so that they function identically when used in different circuits. We used Cello to design 60 circuits for Escherichia coli (880,000 base pairs of DNA), for which each DNA sequence was built as predicted by the software with no additional tuning. Of these, 45 circuits performed correctly in every output state (up to 10 regulators and 55 parts), and across all circuits 92{\%} of the output states functioned as predicted. Design automation simplifies the incorporation of genetic circuits into biotechnology projects that require decision-making, control, sensing, or spatial organization.},

abstract = {We have quantitatively analyzed the relationship between translational efficiency and the mRNA secondary structure in the initiation region. The stability of a defined hairpin structure containing a ribosome binding site was varied over 12 kcal/mol (1 cal = 4.184 J) by site-directed mutagenesis and the effects on protein yields were analyzed in vivo. The results reveal a strict correlation between translational efficiency and the stability of the helix. An increase in its delta G0 of -1.4 kcal/mol (i.e., less than the difference between an A.U and a G.C pair) corresponds to the reduction by a factor of 10 in initiation rate. Accordingly, a single nucleotide substitution led to the decrease by a factor of 500 in expression because it turned a mismatch in the helix into a match. We find no evidence that exposure of only the Shine-Dalgarno region or the start codon preferentially favors recognition. Translational efficiency is strictly correlated with the fraction of mRNA molecules in which the ribosome binding site is unfolded, indicating that initiation is completely dependent on spontaneous unfolding of the entire initiation region. Ribosomes appear not to recognize nucleotides outside the Shine-Dalgarno region and the initiation codon.},

abstract = {Summary A method is described to determine simultaneously the effect of any changes in the ribosome-binding site (RBS) of mRNA on translational efficiency in Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli in vivo. The approach was used to analyse systematically the influence of spacing between the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and the initiation codon, the three different initiation codons, and RBS secondary structure on translational yields in the two organisms. Both B. subtilis and E. coli exhibited similar spacing optima of 7?9 nucleotides. However, B. subtilis translated messages with spacings shorter than optimal much less efficiently than E. coli. In both organisms, AUG was the preferred initiation codon by two- to threefold. In E coli GUG was slightly better than (JUG while in B. subtilis UUG was better than GUG. The degree of emphasis placed on initiation codon type, as measured by translational yield, was dependent on the strength of the Shine-Dalgarno interaction in both organisms. B. subtilis v/as also much less able to tolerate secondary structure in the RBS than E. coli. While significant differences were found between the two organisms in the effect of specific RBS elements on translation, other mRNA components in addition to those elements tested appear to be responsible, in part, for translational species specificity. The approach described provides a rapid and systematic means of elucidating such additional determinants.},

abstract = {The prokaryotic mRNA ribosome binding site (RBS) usually contains part or all of a polypurine domain UAAGGAGGU known as the Shine – Dalgarno (SD) sequence found just 5′ to the translation initiation codon. It is now clear that the SD sequence is important for identification of the translation initiation site on the mRNA by the ribosome, and that as a result, the spacing between the SD and the initiation codon strongly affects translational efficiency (1). It is not as clear, however, whether there is a unique optimal spacing. Complications involving the definition of the spacing as well as secondary structures have obscured matters. We thus undertook a systematic study by inserting two series of synthetic RBSs of varying spacing and SD sequence into a plasmid vector containing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. Care was taken not to introduce any secondary structure. Measurements of protein expression demonstrated an optimal aligned spacing of 5 nt for both series. Since aligned spacing corresponds naturally to the spacing between the 3′-end of the 16s rRNA and the P-site, we conclude that there is a unique optimal aligned SD– AUG spacing in the absence of other complicating issues.},

Translation initiation rate is a rate-limiting step in protein production from mRNA and is dependent on the sequence of the 5'-untranslated region and the start of the coding sequence. Translation rate calculators are programs that estimate protein translation rates based on the sequence of these regions of an mRNA, and as protein expression is proportional to the rate of translation initiation, such calculators have been shown to give good approximations of protein expression levels. In this review, three currently available translation rate calculators developed for synthetic biology are considered, with limitations and possible future progress discussed.},

abstract = {Motivation: RBSDesigner predicts the translation efficiency of existing mRNA sequences and designs synthetic ribosome binding sites (RBSs) for a given coding sequence (CDS) to yield a desired level of protein expression. The program implements the mathematical model for translation initiation described in Na et al. (Mathematical modeling of translation initiation for the estimation of its efficiency to computationally design mRNA sequences with a desired expression level in prokaryotes. BMC Syst. Biol., 4, 71). The program additionally incorporates the effect on translation efficiency of the spacer length between a Shine–Dalgarno (SD) sequence and an AUG codon, which is crucial for the incorporation of fMet-tRNA into the ribosome. RBSDesigner provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for the convenient design of synthetic RBSs.Availability: RBSDesigner is written in Python and Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 and is publicly available as precompiled stand-alone software on the web (http://rbs.kaist.ac.kr).Contact:dhlee@kaist.ac.kr},

@article{Seo2013,
abstract = {Precise prediction of prokaryotic translation efficiency can provide valuable information for optimizing bacterial host for the production of biochemical compounds or recombinant proteins. However, dynamic changes in mRNA folding throughout translation make it difficult to assess translation efficiency. Here, we systematically determined the universal folding regions that significantly affect the efficiency of translation in Escherichia coli. By assessing the specific regions for mRNA folding, we could construct a predictive design method, UTR Designer, and demonstrate that proper codon optimization around the 5′-proximal coding sequence is necessary to achieve a broad range of expression levels. Finally, we applied our method to control the threshold value of input signals switching on a genetic circuit. This should increase our understanding of the processes underlying gene expression and provide an efficient design principle for optimizing various biological systems, thereby facilitating future efforts in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology.},

@article{Goss1998,
abstract = {An integrated understanding of molecular and developmental biology must consider the large number of molecular species involved and the low concentrations of many species in vivo. Quantitative stochastic models of molecular interaction networks can be expressed as stochastic Petri nets (SPNs), a mathematical formalism developed in computer science. Existing software can be used to define molecular interaction networks as SPNs and solve such models for the probability distributions of molecular species. This approach allows biologists to focus on the content of models and their interpretation, rather than their implementation. The standardized format of SPNs also facilitates the replication, extension, and transfer of models between researchers. A simple chemical system is presented to demonstrate the link between stochastic models of molecular interactions and SPNs. The approach is illustrated with examples of models of genetic and biochemical phenomena where the UltraSAN package is used to present results from numerical analysis and the outcome of simulations.

@article{Lee2011,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: As engineered biological systems become more complex, it is increasingly  common to express multiple operons from different plasmids and inducible expression systems within a single host cell. Optimizing such systems often requires screening combinations of origins of replication, expression systems, and antibiotic markers. This procedure is hampered by a lack of quantitative data on how these components behave when more than one origin of replication or expression system are used simultaneously. Additionally, this process can be time consuming as it often requires the creation of new vectors or cloning into existing but disparate vectors. RESULTS: Here, we report the development and characterization of a library of expression vectors compatible with the BglBrick standard (BBF RFC 21). We have designed and constructed 96 BglBrick-compatible plasmids with a combination of replication origins, antibiotic resistance genes, and inducible promoters. These plasmids were characterized over a range of inducer concentrations, in the presence of non-cognate inducer molecules, and with several growth media, and their characteristics were documented in a standard format datasheet. A three plasmid system was used to investigate the impact of multiple origins of replication on plasmid copy number. CONCLUSIONS: The standardized collection of vectors presented here allows the user to rapidly construct and test the expression of genes with various combinations of promoter strength, inducible expression system, copy number, and antibiotic resistance. The quantitative datasheets created for these vectors will increase the predictability of gene expression, especially when multiple plasmids and inducers are utilized.},
