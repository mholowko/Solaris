# Data choices and experimental approach

**Data_log**

For Plate 1 we chose to not use Replicates 1 and 3 - they have been run before a reproducible protocol has been established and introduce unnecesary extra deviation.

**Experimental approach**

For overnight cultures a culture of E. coli with template (pbBB6c-GFP) should be started alongside the plate to be tested (itâ€™s in A1 of Plate 1), with it to be distributed to cell H11 (-IPTG) and H12 (+IPTG) for the runs. 

Reader: 

Overnight culture started the day before (1mL in deep well round plates)  

Restart in the morning into deep well plate, with 1:50 dilution (20uL to 1mL)  

After 90 min transfer to culture microplate (300 uL)  with IPTG added directly to the wells  

8 hour run in the microplate  

Flow Cytometer: 

Overnight culture started the day before (1mL in deep well round plates)  

Restart in the morning into deep well plate, with 1:50 dilution (20uL to 1mL)  

After 90 min transfer to culture microplate (200 uL)  with IPTG added directly to the wells  

Acquisition of data in the flow cytometer after 6 hours of growth in the incubator (counting from the trasnfer to palte with IPTG), dilution of 30x in PBS or LB before run
