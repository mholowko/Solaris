# Data Folder Description

- Results_Masterfile.xlsx: results for RBS design
- Results_Microplate_partialXXX_normXXX_formatXXX_logXXX.csv:   
  generated by codes/data_generating.py, taking the raw data from Results_Masterfile.xlsx and output data used from machine learning pipeline.  
  parameters:  
  - partial: True: use all replicates; False: use only partial replicates indicated in column 'Rep'.
  - norm: True: label normalisation; False: no label normalisation.
  - format: Seq: generate data sequences as rows; Rep: generate data replicates as rows.
  - log: True: logarithm transformation for label; False: no logarithm transformation for label.
- saved_normalised_kernel.pickle:  
  dict: key: kernel name and parameters; value: kernel matrix (4138*4138), where the sequence order are recorded in idx_seq.pickle  
  generated by codes/kernels_for_GPK.py
  Since the file is large, we save this file on ...
- idx_seq.pickle:  
  dict: key: 'idx_seq_dict','idx_list','seq_list'; value: list or dict
  generated by codes/generate_idx_seq.py
  - 'idx_list': list of index, from 0 to 4137
  - 'seq_list': list of RBS sequences
  - 'idx_seq_dict': two-way dict for index and seq
